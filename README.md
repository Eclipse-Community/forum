# EclipseBoard
Forum software written in PHP and MySQL, based on ABXD (an old forum system from the early-mid 2010s).

Mostly intended for [Eclipse Community](https://forum.eclipse.cx/)'s message board, however it *should* theoretically work fine out of the box for your own purposes, too.

## Features
*TODO*

## Why the name 'EclipseBoard'?
I'm uncreative as fuck.

## System Requirements
* PHP 7.4 (mysqli, xml, json and gd extensions required for a base install)
* MariaDB 10.x (STRICT_TRANS_TABLES disabled)
* Web Server (most testing is done with Apache 2.4 on Debian)

Older PHP versions are more than likely to work due to the fact the codebase is so ancient, but bringing it up to work on modern PHP/MariaDB versions properly is a high priority.

## Installation
*TODO*

## Support & Bug Reports
Most maintenance work is currently operated by **pixieditzy**. Feel free to ask them for anything you need. R3n does more design work, but might be able to fix minor issues.

Bug reports are also welcome. If you want an idea of a 'demo board', the Eclipse forums should serve a reasonable example of a real-life instance.
