# RenBoard
Forum software written in PHP and MySQL, based on ABXD (an old forum system from the early-mid 2010s).

Mostly intended for [Eclipse Community](http://forum.eclipse.cx/)'s message board, however it *should* theoretically work fine out of the box for your own purposes, too.

## Features
*TODO*

## Why the name 'RenBoard'?
Purely because Eclipse's branding is owned by forum admin **R3n**, so why not name it after him? Maybe it could have been more original, and/or less 'narcissistic' but hey, he doesn't work on the board software even, so... (Sike -R3n)

## System Requirements
* PHP 7.4 (mysqli, xml, json and gd extensions required for a base install)
* MariaDB 10.x (STRICT_TRANS_TABLES disabled)
* Web Server (most testing is done with Apache 2.4 on Debian)


Older PHP versions are more than likely to work due to the fact the codebase is so ancient, but bringing it up to work on modern PHP/MariaDB versions properly is a high priority.

## Installation
*TODO*

## Support & Bug Reports
Most maintenance work is currently operated by **pixieditzy**. Feel free to ask them for anything you need.

Bug reports are also welcome. If you want an idea of a 'demo board', the Eclipse forums should serve a reasonable example of a real-life instance.
